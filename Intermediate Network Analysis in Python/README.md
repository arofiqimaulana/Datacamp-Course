# Basic Definition

1. Network = Graph = (nodes,eddge)
2. Directed or Undirected 
    - Undirected : Facebook
    - Directed : Twitter
3. networkx : API for analysis of Graph
4. nxviz : API for creating beautiful and rational graph viz

# Bipartite Graph 
1. A graph that is partitioned into two sets
2. nodes are only connected to nodes in other portitions
3. contrast : 'unipartitie'
4. Degree Centrality : measure nodes importance
5. number of possible neighbors depend on graph type

# Concept of Projection
1. useful to investigate the relationship between nodes one partition


# Time Series Analysis
1. global vs local analysis
2. global : how the distribution of some statistics overall nodes changes as a function overtime
3. local :  how the statistics of one or small group of nodes changes overtime
