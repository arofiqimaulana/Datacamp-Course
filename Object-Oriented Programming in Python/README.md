# Object-Oriented Programming

### 1. Procedural Programming vs Object-Oriented Programming :
Procedural Programming
    1. Code as sequence of steps
    2. Great for data analysis and scripts

Object-Oriented Programming 
    1. Code is interactions of objects
    2. Great for building frameworks and tools
    3. Maintanable and reusable code

Object = state + behaviour
States contains attributes (variables)
Behavioir contains method (function)
```
#atributes
import numpy as np
a = np.array([1,2,3,4])
# shape atributes
a.shape

# reshape method
a.reshape(2,2)
```

### 2. Encapsulation
Bundling data with code operating on it.

### 3. Class
Blueprint for objects outlining possible states and behaviours.

### 4. Objects in Python
- Everything in python is an object
- Every object has class
- use type to find class
- Methods are functions, so anything you can do with a function, you can also do with a method.

### 5. Key Terms
1. Method
2. atributes
3. arguments
4. parameters
5. constructor
